### Vehicle-Detection-on-CCTV
- It is not always mandatory to use yolov3 to build an object detector.
- By using cv techniques only one can very much build an object detection algorithm that is cheap and effective over static cameras installed on highways.
- You can improve this framework to detect count of vehicles and can also analyse the pattern during rush hours.
- The first approach works well with static cameras installed on highways.
- The second approach using car.xml is less accurate when camera is non static. In that case we should rather use YOLO or Faster RCNN
